# Age Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
## Overview
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for age detection from facial images. The model is designed to predict the age of a person by analyzing their facial features using deep learning techniques. This project includes the data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation scripts necessary to build and deploy the age detection system.
## Dataset
The model is trained on the UTKFace dataset which contains over 20,000 facial images with labels for age, gender, and ethnicity. Instructions for downloading and preparing the dataset are provided in the repository.
## Libraries used
- tensorflow
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- os
- scikit-learn
- pillow
## Results
The model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately 4.8 years on the test set, indicating its effectiveness in predicting ages within a reasonable range.
